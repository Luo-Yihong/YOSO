## Pre-trained Models
- [YOSO-PixArt-α-512](https://huggingface.co/Luo-Yihong/yoso_pixart512)
- [YOSO-PixArt-α-1024](https://huggingface.co/Luo-Yihong/yoso_pixart1024)
- [YOSO-sd1.5-lora](https://huggingface.co/Luo-Yihong/yoso_sd1.5_lora)

Note that YOSO-PixArt-α-512 is trained on JourneyDB with 512 resolution. YOSO-PixArt-α-1024 is obtained by directly merging YOSO-PixArt-α-512 with PixArt-XL-2-1024-MS.
